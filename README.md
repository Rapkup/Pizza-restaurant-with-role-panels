Hi! This is Asp.Net Core web-application is a temple for pizza-restaurant which have admin panel, manager panel, and user page. This made for temple reusage to your own projects or better understanding how authorization, repository patter or any technology that necessary uses for this type projects. Offcourse it is not a masterpice, but i wish i had that kind of application to play with and explore. 
Soooo to run this, u need to create your own db and put the link to it in appseting.json and update ur db with -migrate command in nu-get package console. After u need to run and route by hands in "/User/Add" to create some roles, after creation u can uncomment in UserController  Authorize for Client manager attribute. That's all u need to make it clear working condition.

Also i can tell more about inside parts of project. There is 3 layers(Repository pattern) and all of them making their own role, Dal is describe work with database for entities(not roles), Bll serves for additional logic to work with the same entities, but also gives us opportunity to change DataBase(Dal layer) without remaking a big parts off existing code. Ui layers consist of MVC pattern and IdentityRole to work with.
